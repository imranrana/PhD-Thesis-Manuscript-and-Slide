@article{ElAdoui2020,
	abstract = {Purpose: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) aims to minimize the tumor size before surgery. Predicting response to NAC could reduce toxicity and delays to effective intervention. Computational analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRI) through deep convolution neural network (CNN) has shown a significant performance to distinguish responders and no responder's patients. This study intends to present a new deep learning (DL) model predicting the breast cancer response to NAC based on multiple MRI inputs. Methods: A cohort of 723 axial slices extracted from 42 breast cancer patients who underwent NAC therapy was used to train and validate the developed DL model. This dataset was provided by our collaborator institute of radiology in Brussels. Fourteen external cases were used to validate the best obtained model to predict pCR based on pre- and post-chemotherapy DCE-MRI. The model performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and feature map visualization. Results: The developed multi-inputs deep learning architecture was able to predict the pCR to NAC treatment in the validation dataset with an AUC of 0.91 using combined pre- and post-NAC images. The visual results showed that the most important extracted features from non-pCR tumors are in the peripheral region. The proposed method was more productive than the previous ones. Conclusion: Even with a limited training dataset size, the proposed and developed CNN model using DCE-MR images acquired before and after the first chemotherapy was able to classify pCR and non-pCR patients with substantial accuracy. This model could be used hereafter in clinical analysis after its evaluation based on more extra data.},
