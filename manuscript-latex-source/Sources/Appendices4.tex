The data that support the findings of this study are openly available at the elicitation page of DAPPEM website\footnote{\url{https://dappem.limos.fr/elicitation.html} (visited on 02/20/2023)}. The data can be accessed by clicking on \enquote{\textit{Download Research Data}} link. Available files are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textit{Elicited Probability.xlxs} : contains the 1536 possible cases and the corresponding elicited EM probability estimates.}
	\item{\textit{EM Decision Tree.png} : detailed version of the pruned decision tree described in Section \ref{sec:resanddis}.}
	\item{\textit{FCA Context Files}: this directory contains FCA lattice context files for different probability groups of EM cases. The context files can be explored using FCA software like The Concept Explorer \cite{ConExp} or Formal Concept Analysis Research Toolbox (FCART)\cite{FCART}. Following is the list of files inside this directory: }
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{\textit{Group (1).cxt} : cases with probability $[0,0.1)$.}
		\item{\textit{Group (2).cxt} : cases with probability $[0.1,0.2)$.}
		\item{\textit{Group (4).cxt} : cases with probability $[0.3,0.4)$.}
		\item{\textit{Group (5).cxt} : cases with probability $[0.4,0.5)$.}
		\item{\textit{Group (6).cxt} : cases with probability $[0.5,0.6)$.}
		\item{\textit{Group (7).cxt} : cases with probability $[0.6,0.7)$.}
		\item{\textit{Group (8).cxt} : cases with probability $[0.7,0.8)$.}
		\item{\textit{Group (9).cxt} : cases with probability $[0.8,0.9)$.}
		\item{\textit{Group (10).cxt} : cases with probability $[0.9,1]$.}
